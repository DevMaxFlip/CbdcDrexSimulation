 Real Asset Tokenization and Transaction System (CBDC)

This repository contains Solidity smart contracts for managing the tokenization and transaction of real assets, potentially including the Brazilian Digital Real (Drex) and other real-asset-backed tokens.

**System Components:**

1. **ERC20 Contracts:**
    * `RealDigital`: ERC20 implementation to represent the Brazilian Digital Real (Drex) or another tokenized real asset.
    * `RealTokezinado`: Generic ERC20 implementation to represent other tokenized assets.

2. **Atomic Swap Contract:**
    * `SwapOneStep`: Facilitates atomic swaps between `RealDigital` and `RealTokezinado` in a single contract, ensuring both parties receive their tokens without fraud risk.

3. **Minting/Burning Control Contract:**
    * `STR`: Controls the authorization for minting and burning `RealDigital` tokens, restricting these actions to a predefined set of participants.

**Features:**

* **Real Asset Tokenization:** The `RealDigital` and `RealTokezinado` contracts enable the digital representation of real assets on the blockchain, facilitating transaction and fractionalization.
* **Atomic Transfers:** `SwapOneStep` allows for instant swaps of `RealDigital` and `RealTokezinado` tokens without intermediaries, minimizing counterparty risk.
* **Minting/Burning Control:** `STR` restricts the creation and destruction of `RealDigital` tokens to an authorized group, ensuring proper token supply management.

**Technologies Used:**

* Solidity (version ^0.8.18)
* ERC20 Standard

**Notes:**

* This project provides a foundation for real asset tokenization and transaction on the blockchain.
* Real-world implementation may require additional security and compliance considerations and adaptations.
* Integration with oracles and payment gateways may be necessary to connect the system to the real world.

**Potential Use Cases:**

* Issuance and management of central bank digital currency (CBDC)
* Tokenization of real assets such as real estate, commodities, and precious metals
* Facilitation of international transactions with real assets
* Creation of new decentralized marketplaces for tokenized assets

**Contributions:**

* Feel free to contribute to the project's development!
* Code improvements, bug fixes, and new features are welcome.
* Join the community to discuss ideas and collaborate on the future of the real asset tokenization and transaction system.
